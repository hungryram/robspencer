As the Principal Broker of Upstage Real Estate, it is my pleasure to serve both buyers and sellers in the largest, and possibly most challenging transaction of their lives. I've learned the value of hard work and promise to give the families I work with the very best I can.   
Here are some assurances:  
  
 1. Total and complete honesty. My faith is a huge part of my life and it compels me to always tell the truth, even when it may be tough to hear.  
  
 2. 100% confidence in my service. I will give the very best service I can to your family, and I'll never make you feel as if I do not have time for you.  
  
 3. Professionalism and dedication. My goal has always been, and will continue to be your best interests being served. I've never put money above what's best for my clients, and never will.   
  
I serve all of NEA and I'd be honored if you gave me the chance to serve your family.
